## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DiabEaseDetect.git
2. **Install node modules for front end :**

   ```bash
   npm install
3. **After that run the front end **

   ```bash
   npm start
4. **Make new terminal for running backend and run:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
5. **After that Run the app.py file debug it **

   ```bash
   In VS Code CTRL+F5  for debug start
6. **Now app is running on some url:**

   ```bash
   copy the url and paste it in Front End src/Views/DiabteseForm.js in the handleformsubmit function go to fetch method and paste the url like this: 
   fetch('http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict')
